#INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the CMPG 323 module projects repository! This repository is where I manage and document the projects I'll be working on this semester. Each project is aimed at improving my skills in software development, project management, and using technologies like Agile methods, cloud computing, robotic process automation (RPA), and data visualization.

# Project 1 - Agile (Scrum)
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: This project teaches Agile principles, especially Scrum, for managing projects well. It focuses on developing things step-by-step, being flexible with changes, and giving value bit by bit to the people involved.
  Branching Strategy:  Feature branches are created from main for development and merged back via pull requests.
  
# Project 2 - NWU Tech Trends CRUD API
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will create a basic web tool on Azure that handles data about how often our automations run. I use Visual Studio and .NET to build it, and I stick to a simple way of arranging how the web addresses work. 
  Branching Strategy: Development happens on the develop branch, features are branched off develop, and releases are managed through release branches.
  
# Project 3 - Blazor Application Enhancement
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will improve a Blazor app that already adds, edits, and removes info about projects and clients. I use Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 8 to make sure everything is set up well and follows good ways of writing code.
  Branching Strategy:  Feature branches are created from main for development and merged back via pull requests.

# Project 4 - UiPath RPA Implementation
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will use UiPath to make robots that do jobs automatically. I will set them up to work with the current systems and make sure everything runs smoothly.
  Branching Strategy:  Feature branches are created from main for development and merged back via pull requests.

# Project 5 - Power BI Reporting
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description:In this project, I will make graphs and charts with Power BI to show how much time our automated projects save. I will use Power BI Desktop to create these reports and Azure to store and organize the data. 
  ## Branching Strategy: Development happens on the develop branch, features are branched off develop, and releases are managed through release branches.
