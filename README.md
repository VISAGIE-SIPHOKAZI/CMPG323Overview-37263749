# CMPG323Overview-37263749


Welcome to the CMPG 323 module projects repository! This repository is where I manage and document the projects I'll be working on this semester. Each project is aimed at improving my skills in software development, project management, and using technologies like Agile methods, cloud computing, robotic process automation (RPA), and data visualization.

# Project 1 - Agile (Scrum)
  ## Repository: https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: This project teaches Agile principles, especially Scrum, for managing projects well. It focuses on developing things step-by-step, being flexible with changes, and giving value bit by bit to the people involved.
  

# Project 2 - NWU Tech Trends CRUD API
  ## Repository:  https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will create a basic web tool on Azure that handles data about how often our automations run. I will use Visual Studio and .NET to build it, and I stick to a simple way of arranging how the web addresses work. 
  
# Project 3 - Blazor Application Enhancement
  ## Repository:  https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will improve a Blazor app that already adds, edits, and removes info about projects and clients. I will use Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 8 to make sure everything is set up well and follows good ways of writing code.

# Project 4 - UiPath RPA Implementation
  ## Repository:  https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description: In this project, I will use UiPath to make robots that do jobs automatically. I will set them up to work with the current systems and make sure everything runs smoothly.

# Project 5 - Power BI Reporting
  ## Repository:  https://github.com/VISAGIE-SIPHOKAZI/CMPG323Overview-37263749
  Description:In this project, I will make graphs and charts with Power BI to show how much time our automated projects save. I will use Power BI Desktop to create these reports and Azure to store and organize the data. 


 ### Branching Strategy:  A well-defined branching strategy helps in managing code changes efficiently and ensuring that development, testing, and production workflows are smooth.
    Main Branch: Production-ready code. Merge only after thorough testing.  
    Develop Branch: Integration of new features and bug fixes before merging into main.  
    Bug-Fix Branches: Address specific bugs. Merge into the relevant branch after fixes.  
    Release Branches: Prepare code for release.

    
  ### Gitignore Files: The .gitignore file is used to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. It helps keep your repository clean by ignoring unnecessary or sensitive files that donâ€™t need to be version-controlled.
    Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
    Environment files (.env)
    IDE/editor settings (.vscode/)

  ### Credentials and Sensitive Information
    Credentials and sensitive information should never be stored directly in your Git repositories.
    Environment Variables: Store sensitive data in environment variables.
    Configuration Files: Use .env files locally and ignore them in Git.
    Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data if needed.
    Access Controls: Restrict access to sensitive information to authorized users.
